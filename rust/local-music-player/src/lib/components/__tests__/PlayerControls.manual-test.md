- [ ] On tablet (768-1024px): Track info and volume control are smaller
- [ ] On mobile (<768px): Elements stack vertically
- [ ] On small mobile (<480px): Buttons are smaller, minimal spacing
- [ ] All elements remain accessible and usable at all sizes

### 10. Error Handling

**Test**: Verify component handles edge cases gracefully

## Bug Reporting

If any test fails or unexpected behavior is observed:

1. Note the specific test case and steps to reproduce
2. Record browser and OS information
3. Check browser console for any error messages
4. Document expected vs actual behavior
5. Take screenshots if visual issues are present

## Notes

- Some functionality may depend on the Rust backend being properly implemented
- Audio playback features require actual audio files and working audio system
- Network-related features may require proper API endpoints
